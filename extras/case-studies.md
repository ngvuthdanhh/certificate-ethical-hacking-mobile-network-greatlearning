# Case Studies – Ethical Hacking in Mobile Platforms & Network Architecture

## 1. WhatsApp Vulnerability (2019)
- Attackers exploited a buffer overflow in the VoIP stack.
- Result: Remote code execution through a missed call.
- Lesson: Even widely used apps can be exploited through core functionalities.

## 2. Mobile Banking Trojans
- Malware disguised as legitimate banking apps.
- Captured user credentials and bypassed SMS-based 2FA.
- Lesson: Multi-layer authentication is essential.

## 3. SS7 Exploits in Telecom
- Attackers intercepted SMS-based 2FA using SS7 vulnerabilities.
- Result: Account takeover in several high-profile cases.
- Lesson: SMS is insecure as a primary authentication method.

## 4. SIM Swapping Attacks
- Attackers socially engineered telecom providers to transfer victim’s number.
- Result: Hijacked cryptocurrency accounts and emails.
- Lesson: User awareness + provider policies must be strengthened.
