# 04 â€“ Mobile Network Architecture

Understanding how telecom networks function helps identify vulnerabilities.

## Core Concepts
- GSM, LTE, 5G architectures.  
- Signaling protocols: SS7, Diameter.  
- Vulnerabilities in roaming, handover, and authentication.  

## Real-World Issues
- IMSI catchers intercepting calls.  
- SS7 exploitation for SMS/call rerouting.  
- Location tracking attacks.
